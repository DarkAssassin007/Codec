# 🔐 Cryptography Algorithm Toolkit

A beginner-friendly, real-time Python project that demonstrates core concepts of *modern cryptography* using *AES (symmetric encryption), **RSA (asymmetric encryption), and **SHA256 (hashing)*. Designed to simulate real-world use cases like secure messaging, file encryption, and password hashing.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Implement and understand core cryptographic techniques:
  - *AES* for secure data encryption/decryption
  - *RSA* for public/private key cryptography
  - *SHA256* for one-way data hashing
- Provide real-time user interaction
- Create a modular, scalable architecture
- Learn encryption workflow with file input/output and key handling

---

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- *Language:* Python 3.8+
- *Libraries Used:*
  - cryptography for AES & RSA
  - hashlib for SHA256
  - os, base64, json for file/key management
- *Structure:* Modular folder system (/modules)
- *Optional Tools:* PyCrypto, OpenSSL, tkinter (for GUI expansion)

## 🧪 Features & Demonstrations

### 🔐 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Generate and save AES key
- Encrypt user input messages
- Decrypt saved encrypted messages
- Use Fernet for secure symmetric encryption

### 🔑 RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- Generate RSA key pair (public/private)
- Encrypt a message using the public key
- Decrypt it using the private key
- Save/load RSA keys in .pem format

### 🔁 SHA256 Hashing
- Hash plain text securely
- Hash any file for integrity checking
- Compare original vs current hash for tamper detection

## 🧪 Sample Outputs

### 🔐 Sample AES Output

bash
Enter message to encrypt: Hello Aakash
Encrypted: gAAAAABo...
Decrypted: Hello Aakash


### 🔐 RSA Output

bash
Enter message to encrypt: SecretMessage
Encrypted with Public Key: b'...'
Decrypted with Private Key: SecretMessage


### 🔐SHA256 Output

bash
Copy code
Input text: AAKASH
Hash: ac98f72f...


## 📌 Future Improvements

✅ Add GUI with Tkinter or PyQt
✅ Support file encryption/decryption
✅ Add digital signature verification
